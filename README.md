# Aniwave-Auto-Best-Resolution
Automatcially select the highest resolution on vidplay/mycloud streams


I've have not written any of the script. Simply updated to match the rebranding from 9anime to Aniwave.
Based on https://greasyfork.org/da/scripts/457379-9anime-auto-best-resolution
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Automatically selects the best resolution for Vidplay and MyCloud.

Sometimes there will come a new domain. You can add a user match.

I will try and keep it updated.
